# Incompressible fluid (like water), density must remain constant througout

# "Velocity field"
# Grid of pixels, must act in a box. say matrix of 512 by 512 (always good to have something to power 2, for square shaped grids)
# each cell in grid has velocity vector that points to given direction
# if velocity vector in each grid, water is completely still

# imagine adding a dye, of which the density changes in the velocity field
# DyeDensity (for visualisation)
